# Components

## Capacitors

### Stepper Driver
Goal is 100uF for each stepper driver, anything over this is fine too (slightly under will work, but let's try to keep it up).

### Rectifier
We want something large.
TODO: Check how much is enough.

## Resistors

### Pull-up/Pull-down

Nominally 10K - use anything this large or greater as available.
